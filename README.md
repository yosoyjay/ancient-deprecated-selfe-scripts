# Rando ancient SELFE scripts

A collection of ancient scripts used for pre- and post-processing of SELFE model runs at CMOP.

I believe all of these scripts were deprecated by ~2013, but I'm putting in this repo just in case
they are needed at some point.

Some of this I wrote, but a lot was written by Nate Hyde, Grant Law, and I assume Charles Seaston
and Paul Turner.
