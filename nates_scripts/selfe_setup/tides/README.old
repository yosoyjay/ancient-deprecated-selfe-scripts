Generate tidal amplitudes and phases with a fort.14 like Adcirc.
Run on ambcs01.

To create tidal amplitudes and phases, you need fort.14
(1) get the x,y,depth part of fort.14 (hgrid.gr3) only (No space allowed at the
    beginning of each line! with %s/^ *//g); keep the rest as table;
(2) run spcs.pl (ambcs01) to get fort.14.ll (lat-long)
    (input: fort.14; fort.14.ll; 2; 1; 8; 1; 3601; wo; 2);
(3) put the first 2 lines & table of fort.14 to fort.14.ll (or hgrid.ll; as grid format);
(4) run ecp.f to get *.nos8;
(5) make sure all nodes are inside edpac2xy.gr3; if not, move them inside.
    Re-connect bc part of fort.14 to *.nos8;
(6) run genbcs.f to get *.sta;
(7) run intel_deg.f. (input: edpac2xy.gr3; *.sta; teanl.tct; ap.dat)
