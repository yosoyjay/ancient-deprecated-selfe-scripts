Post-processing API library based on FORTRAN

(1) extract_mod.f90: data structure and I/O routines used for extraction;
(2) extract_timeseries.f90: extract time series at given points (including vertical transects);
(3) extract_xyzt.f90: extract results at specifid (x,y,z,t) or (x,y,t) points.
                      The field examples for these 2 options are glider or CTD casts.
(4) extract_slab.f90: extract results at all grid nodes along a horizontal slab,
                      either at a fixed z or a fixed distance from free surface, or
                      along a S level (e.g., free surface and bottom); 
(5) *.sample: sample station input files for extraction scripts in this directory;
(6) compute_zcor.f90: a stand-alone routine that shows how to compute z coordinates in SELFE.

Use Makefile to compile 3 programs in (2-4).

------------------------------------------------------------
Python wrappers:

Makefile.py contains f2py command for generating .so and wrapper (with full 
debugging turned on).

read_stations.py gives an example python script for reading a transect 
or single depth stations, and generates an example image from that.

There is a single pair of lines (defining the the set of points to use) 
that needs to be switched which one is commented out to change the 
script from doing a profiles or single depth stations. I also include 
the line to read the stations from your sample file (commented out).
